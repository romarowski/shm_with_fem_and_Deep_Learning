# MS Thesis

*Abstract:*
The work aims to develop a methodology for monitoring the structural health of one-dimensional slender structures using sparse sensor measurements. Two distinct problems are addressed: the static and dynamic response of an Euler-Bernoulli beam. A linear regression model is trained for the static problem while a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short Term Memory units is used for the dynamic one. The generation of the training dataset is obtained by means of a finite element code implemented ad-hoc in Python while the training itself is performed using Tensorflow / Keras and scikit-learn. Some results are presented to validate the proposed method and to evaluate the predictive capabilities as the type of data available varies (e.g. different positioning of the sensors).
